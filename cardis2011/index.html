                <p class="meta">Tenth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference</p>
				<div class="entry">
<p>
Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference dedicated to smart
card research and applications. Smart cards, or by extension smart devices are
the basis for many secure systems and play a decisive role in ID management.
Established computer science areas like hardware design, operating systems,
modeling systems, cryptography or distributed systems got adapted to this fast
growing technology and investigate emerging issues resulting from it. Unlike
events devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS
conferences gather researchers and technologists who focused on all aspects of
the design, development, deployment, validation and application of smart cards
or smart personal devices.

The tenth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application IFIP Conference,
organized by COSIC laboratory, will be held in Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
Leuven, Belgium. It will be co-located with <a
